### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer at [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io) where I work with the cloud team. I work full stack with go and react.

Away from computers, I love to play music 🎸 cook 👨‍🍳 and paddleboard. And most of all build Lego with my son, Dylan. 

I also enjoy reading 📖 and listening to audiobooks. Please share suggestions 🙂

My resume 📋 is at [bit.ly/iangregson-resume](http://bit.ly/iangregson-resume).
