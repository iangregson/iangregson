### Hi there 👋

I'm an Senior Engineer / Manager at Bigtincan where I work on Scorecards - a data analytics product - and Genie AI, a platform for helping our products deploy AI / LLM technologies.

I was previously an early engineer at Rekener, a Charlestown startup, where we built the Scorecards product. Still crunching two acquisitions later 🔥

Away from computers, I love to play music 🎸 cook 👨‍🍳 and paddleboard. And most of all build Lego with my son, Dylan. 

I also enjoy reading 📖 and listening to audiobooks. Please share suggestions 🙂

My resume 📋 is at [bit.ly/iangregson-resume](http://bit.ly/iangregson-resume).
