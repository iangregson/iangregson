### Hi there 👋

I work at Bigtincan on Scorecards, a data analytics product; and Genie AI, a platform for helping our products deploy AI / LLM technologies.

I was previously an early engineer at Rekener, where we built the Scorecards product. Still going two acquisitions later 🔥

I love to read 📖 and listen to audiobooks. Please share suggestions 🙂
