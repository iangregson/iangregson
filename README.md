### Hi there 👋

I'm an Senior Engineer / Manager at Bigtincan where I work on Scorecards - a data analytics product - and Genie AI, a platform for helping our products deploy AI / LLM technologies.

I was previously an early engineer at Rekener, a Charlestown startup, where we built the Scorecards product. Still crunching two acquisitions later 🔥

I love to read 📖 and listen to audiobooks. Please share suggestions 🙂

My resume 📋 is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AGRHyeQBHpLqKiZTLZAYySTOxchLrkIl/view?usp=sharing)
